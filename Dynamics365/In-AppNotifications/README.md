# In-App Notifications

## Samples:

### PowerShell

This will loop through all apps in a tenant and set the in-app notification enablement.

### Dataverse Solutions

This contains a managed and unmanaged solution to set the in-app notification for a specific app by using its friendly name e.g. 'Sales Hub'.

The setting is called 'AllowNotificationsEarlyAccess' and the value needs to be true to turn on.

The broadcast in-app notifications to all users flow shows how to get all users and send a notification.

The payload or the HTTP call looks like this:

{

 "title": "Welcome from Postman",

 "body": "Welcome to the world of app notifications!",

 "icontype": 100000000, // info

 "toasttype": 200000000 // timed

}

The in-app notification feature uses three tables, and a user needs to have the correct security roles to receive notifications and send notifications to themselves, or other users.
